# James Smith's Portfolio
My name is James Emerson Smith IV, and I am an experienced Hydrologist/ Geologist
fascinated with the processes that govern the earth and drive surficial landscape evolution. In
December 2018, I graduated with a Master of Science degree from Louisiana State University
within the Geology and Geophysics Department. For the past 3 years, I have worked as a hydrologist
with the USDA at the National Sedimentation Laboratoty (NSL) in Oxford, MS. My work at the NSL is focused 
on fluvial hydraulics and sediment transport dynamics. Currently, I am investigating the use of accelerometer 
impact plates to study bedload sediment transport in gravel bedded rivers.
